## üîã **STORAGE ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS**

### **Cost per kWh Comparison:**
| Technology | Cost (EUR/kWh) | Competitiveness |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| PyPSA H2 (optimistic) | ‚Ç¨0.094 | ‚úÖ Very competitive |
| **Realistic H2 (market)** | **‚Ç¨5.00** | ‚ùå Extremely expensive |
| Battery storage | ‚Ç¨0.132 | ‚úÖ 38x cheaper than realistic H2 |
| Iron-Air storage | ‚Ç¨0.027 | ‚úÖ **185x cheaper than realistic H2** |

### **Alternative Storage Scenarios:**
To replace 30.7 TWh of hydrogen storage:
- **Battery Alternative:** 4.0 billion EUR (38x cheaper than realistic H2)
- **Iron-Air Alternative:** 0.8 billion EUR (**188x cheaper than realistic H2**)
- **Realistic H2 Cost:** 155.6 billion EUR

## üö® **CRITICAL IMPLICATIONS**

### **1. Economic Viability**
- ‚ùå **Realistic H2 storage is 185x more expensive than Iron-Air batteries**
- ‚ùå **Realistic H2 storage is 38x more expensive than Li-ion batteries**
- ‚ùå **Total H2 system cost increases from 21.5 to 397.3 billion EUR**

### **2. Technology Choice Impact**
With realistic costs, the optimal technology mix would likely shift to:
- **Iron-Air batteries** for long-duration storage (100+ hours)
- **Li-ion batteries** for short-duration storage (‚â§10 hours)
- **Pumped hydro** where geographically feasible
- **Minimal or no hydrogen storage** due to prohibitive costs

### **3. Model Accuracy**
- **PyPSA's optimistic costs** lead to hydrogen-dominated solutions
- **Market reality** makes these solutions economically unfeasible
- **Cost assumptions** critically determine optimal technology mix

## üìä **HYDROGEN IMPORTS & AUTARKY**

### **Configuration Updates Made:**
‚úÖ **Disabled hydrogen imports** from other countries  
‚úÖ **Enabled autarky** - Germany must be self-sufficient  
‚úÖ **Updated all hydrogen technology costs** to market reality  
‚úÖ **Set realistic hydrogen storage CAPEX** to ‚Ç¨5,000/MWh

## üèÅ **CONCLUSION**

The analysis reveals a **fundamental disconnect** between PyPSA's optimistic hydrogen cost assumptions and market reality:

1. **PyPSA's optimized solution** relies on hydrogen storage costing ‚Ç¨0.094/kWh
2. **Realistic market costs** are ‚Ç¨5.00/kWh (**53x higher**)
3. **Total system cost** increases from 21.5 to **397.3 billion EUR** (18.5x higher)
4. **Alternative technologies** (Iron-Air, batteries) are **38-188x cheaper**

**The viability of massive hydrogen storage deployment critically depends on achieving the aggressive cost reductions assumed in PyPSA optimization models.** With current market costs, alternative storage technologies offer far more economical solutions for Germany's renewable energy integration.
