## üéØ Key Insights

1. **Solar Dominance**: Solar PV provides nearly 60% of all generation capacity, reflecting Germany's strong solar resource and cost-competitiveness by 2035.

2. **Wind Power**: Wind (onshore + offshore) contributes 133.8 GW total, providing critical baseload and dispatchable renewable generation.

3. **Storage Strategy**: The system employs a three-tier storage approach:
   - **Short-duration (3-5h)**: Home batteries and pumped hydro for daily cycling
   - **Medium-duration (10h)**: Grid-scale lithium batteries for load shifting
   - **Long-duration (400+h)**: Hydrogen storage for seasonal balancing

4. **Near-100% Renewable**: At 96.8% renewable penetration, the system maintains only 4.1 GW of nuclear for grid stability services.

5. **Massive Storage Deployment**: 31.6 TWh of storage energy capacity indicates the critical role of storage in enabling very high renewable penetration.

## üîç Technology Notes

**Missing Technologies**: Iron-air batteries, vanadium redox flow batteries, and compressed air energy storage (CAES) were not selected by the optimization. This suggests that under the assumed cost projections and system requirements, lithium-ion batteries and hydrogen storage provided more cost-effective solutions.

**Hydrogen Dominance**: The massive hydrogen storage deployment (31.1 TWh) reflects the need for seasonal energy storage to balance renewable variability across winter/summer periods.

**Battery Duration**: Grid-scale batteries operate at ~10h duration, which is optimal for daily load shifting and renewable smoothing.
