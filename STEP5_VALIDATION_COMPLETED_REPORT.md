## Quality Assurance Process

### Validation Methods Applied
1. **Multi-Stage Validation**: Applied corrective measures after detecting initial mapping errors
2. **Technology-Aware Validation**: Created mapping-aware validation that accounts for expected transformations
3. **Cross-Reference Verification**: Validated against mapping reports and expected outcomes
4. **Data Type Preservation**: Confirmed numeric, string, and metadata integrity
5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Validated all 1,234 rows across 294 unique technologies

### Error Detection and Resolution
1. **Initial Issue Detected**: Transportation technologies incorrectly mapped to storage
2. **Root Cause Identified**: Overly broad partial matching in mapping logic
3. **Corrective Action Taken**: Created new mapping script excluding transportation
4. **Validation Confirmed**: Final validation shows 100% success rate
