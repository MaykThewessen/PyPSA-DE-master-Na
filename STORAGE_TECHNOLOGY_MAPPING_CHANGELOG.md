- ✅ Column structure preserved: 7 columns maintained
- ✅ Non-storage technologies untouched: All generation, conversion, and infrastructure technologies preserved
- ✅ Transportation technologies correctly excluded from mapping

### Mapping Validation
- ✅ All storage technology names follow PyPSA conventions
- ✅ Component suffixes standardized (-store, -charger, -discharger, -bicharger)
- ✅ No duplicate target names created
- ✅ Technology categorization maintained (actual storage vs. transportation)

## Issues and Anomalies Encountered

### Resolved Issues
1. **Previous Incorrect Mapping**: Found existing mapping that incorrectly treated electric vehicles as energy storage
   - **Resolution**: Reverted to original file and applied corrected mapping
   - **Backup Created**: costs_2035_mapped_INCORRECT_BACKUP.csv

2. **Inconsistent Naming Conventions**: Multiple naming formats for same technologies
   - **Examples**: "battery inverter" vs "battery_inverter", "H2" vs "hydrogen"
   - **Resolution**: Applied systematic standardization using mapping dictionary

3. **Component Type Confusion**: Some technologies mixed storage and power components
   - **Resolution**: Clearly separated -store (energy) from -charger/-discharger (power) components

### No Critical Issues
- ✅ No data loss occurred
- ✅ No invalid technology names created  
- ✅ No conflicts between storage and non-storage technologies
- ✅ All transportation technologies properly preserved

## Process Documentation

### Mapping Methodology
1. **Technology Classification**: Separated actual energy storage from transportation
2. **Standardization Rules**: Applied PyPSA naming conventions
3. **Component Separation**: Distinguished energy storage from power conversion components
4. **Validation**: Cross-checked all mappings for consistency

### Files Used in Process
- **Source**: costs_2035.csv (original technology data)
- **Mapping Logic**: apply_corrected_technology_mapping.py
- **Validation**: technology_mapping_report.txt
- **Reference**: storage_mapping_summary.csv (comprehensive mapping dictionary)

## Conclusion

The storage technology mapping process successfully standardized 31 different technology naming variants affecting 114 entries while correctly preserving 49 transportation technology entries. The mapping improves PyPSA model compatibility while maintaining data integrity and avoiding confusion between energy storage and transportation technologies.

**Key Achievements**:
- ✅ Systematic standardization of energy storage technology names
- ✅ Clear separation of storage vs. transportation technologies  
- ✅ Preservation of all original data with proper backup
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation for future reference
- ✅ PyPSA-compatible naming conventions implemented

**Files Ready for Production**:
