2. **Power Equipment**: 77.6% of total cost
   - Electrolysis: 23.2%
   - Fuel cells: 54.4%

### Key Insights
- The hydrogen storage system provides **17.3 days** of storage duration
- **Energy storage cost** is very competitive at **0.094 EUR/kWh**
- **Power equipment dominates costs**, especially fuel cells for discharging
- The asymmetric power capacity (75 GW fuel cell vs 20 GW electrolysis) suggests:
  - Fast discharge capability for peak demand
  - Slower charging during low-demand periods
  - Optimized for seasonal storage cycles

### Comparison Context
- Battery storage: typically 10+ EUR/kWh for energy
- Pumped hydro: ~1-5 EUR/kWh but geographically limited
- **H2 storage energy cost of 0.094 EUR/kWh is exceptionally competitive**

## Strategic Value
The hydrogen storage system provides:
- **31.1 TWh** of seasonal energy storage
- Critical long-duration storage for renewable integration
- **17+ days** of continuous discharge capability
- Economic energy storage at **0.094 EUR/kWh**

This represents a massive deployment enabling Germany's 96.8% renewable electricity system in 2035.
