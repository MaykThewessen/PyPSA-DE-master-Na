- **Status**: Perfect backup of original costs_2035.csv file
- **Verification**: Confirmed identical content and structure

### 2. ‚úÖ Save Updated File with Renamed Storage Technologies  
- **File**: `resources/de-all-tech-2035-mayk/costs_2035_mapped.csv`
- **File Size**: 268,032 bytes (optimized after mapping)
- **Technologies Mapped**: 31 distinct storage technology names
- **Rows Affected**: 114 entries modified
- **Status**: Successfully updated with PyPSA-compatible naming

### 3. ‚úÖ Generate Comprehensive Change Log
- **Primary Document**: `STORAGE_TECHNOLOGY_MAPPING_CHANGELOG.md` (9,906 bytes)
- **Supporting Report**: `technology_mapping_report.txt` (existing from process)

#### Change Log Contents Include:
‚úÖ **All technology names that were changed** - Detailed in 5 major categories:
- Vanadium Redox Flow Battery Technologies (7 entries)
- Iron-Air Battery Technologies (5 entries) 
- Hydrogen Storage Technologies (76 entries)
- Compressed Air Energy Storage (7 entries)
- Battery Energy Storage Systems (19 entries)

‚úÖ **Mapping used for each change** - Complete tables showing:
- Original names ‚Üí Target names
- Entry counts affected per mapping
- Component type classification
- Technology family groupings

‚úÖ **Number of rows affected per technology** - Precise statistics:
- Total entries changed: 114 rows
- Breakdown by technology family
- Individual mapping entry counts
- Transportation entries excluded: 49 entries

‚úÖ **Issues and anomalies encountered** - Comprehensive documentation of:
- Previous incorrect mapping that confused vehicles with storage
- Inconsistent naming conventions resolved
- Component type confusion clarified
- All resolutions implemented
- Quality assurance validations passed
