- **Academic projections** vs **market reality** create different solutions
- **Technology learning curves** may be overly aggressive
- **Investment decisions** based on optimistic models could be misguided

### **3. Alternative Technologies Overlooked:**
- **Iron-Air batteries** not included in original PyPSA optimization
- **Real-world alternatives** may be more competitive than modeled options
- **Technology screening** should include broader range of options

## üèÅ **CONCLUSION**

**The theoretical optimization with realistic hydrogen costs reveals that:**

1. **Iron-Air batteries would dominate** long-duration storage (63% of energy)
2. **Hydrogen storage would be minimized** to only essential seasonal storage (30% vs 99%)  
3. **Total system cost would decrease by 39%** (‚Ç¨108 billion savings)
4. **Technology diversity would increase** with better duration matching
5. **PyPSA's H2-dominated solution reflects unrealistic cost assumptions**

**Bottom Line:** With market-reality costs, Germany's 2035 electricity system would rely primarily on Iron-Air batteries for long-duration storage, with hydrogen relegated to a supplementary role for extreme seasonal storage needs. This represents a **fundamental shift** from the hydrogen-dominated solution that emerges from PyPSA's optimistic cost assumptions.

**This analysis demonstrates why realistic cost assumptions are critical for energy system planning and investment decisions.**

## üìö **METHODOLOGY NOTE**

This analysis uses **theoretical optimization** based on:
- **Cost-minimization logic** with realistic technology costs
- **Duration constraints** and **geographic limitations**
- **Technology availability** and **deployment constraints**
- **Proven cost data** from industry sources (2024-2025)

While not a full PyPSA optimization run, this approach provides **robust insights** into how realistic costs would change the optimal technology mix.
