## Usage Guidelines for PyPSA-DE

### Loading the Costs File
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load costs data
costs = pd.read_csv("resources/de-all-tech-2035-mayk/costs_2035_mapped.csv")

# Extract technology costs
battery_cost = costs[
    (costs['technology'] == 'battery-store') & 
    (costs['parameter'] == 'investment')
]['value'].iloc[0]  # 134.0 EUR/kWh
```

### Adding Storage Technologies
```python
import pypsa

# Create network
n = pypsa.Network()

# Add battery storage using costs file data
n.add("Store", "battery", bus="bus",
      e_nom_extendable=True, 
      capital_cost=battery_cost,
      e_cyclic=True)
```

### Optimization Results
